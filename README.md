# Portfolio

A simple website to showcase the projects I've worked on.
## Inspiration

Many developers out there already has their own portfolio website, thus I shall try my hands at one. Plus [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) looks handy and would like to play around with it. 

## Live version
You can check the live version [here](https://tech.devv.nl) [WIP].


## Running
To run this website locally, simply do:

```ts
	yarn
	yarn start
```
